# NAPS2 + Printer Scanning App

A modern, browser-based scanning solution inspired by **NAPS2**.  
This app provides an easy-to-use **React + Tailwind** frontend with an **Express** backend that integrates directly with scanner hardware. Documents are captured, processed, and returned as **Base64-encoded PDFs**, which are displayed seamlessly inside an `<iframe>` for preview or printing.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Frontend (React + Tailwind)**

  - Clean, responsive UI with TailwindCSS
  - Document preview in an `<iframe>` (Base64 PDF rendering)
